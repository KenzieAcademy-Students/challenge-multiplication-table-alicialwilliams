# Kenzie Academy Challenge: Multiplication Table

Follow the instructions provided on `my.kenzie.academy` for this challenge. The `code.js` file is a placeholder. Feel free to rename it or add additional files to the project.

Customize this README.md however you want to turn it into documentation for your project (including deleting these opening paragraphs). The only required sections are the **Project Plan** and **Reflection** below. Be sure to use proper Markdown syntax in this file (here's a [cheatsheet PDF](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) of the basic syntax).

## Project Plan

_(Put your project plan here. 
Basic Plan
1) Create a table element in the HTML file with id mult-table.
2) Get element by id in JS file
3) for loops for the table data  rows and columns and output results 
4) Style the table with css

Intermediate Plan
1) Create another branch naming it devInterTable
2)  Create a button element in the HTML file
3) Create input number boxes labeled columns and rows
4) RE-work the for loops to push (add) a new row and column

## Reflection

What different approaches or techniques did you consider when planning your implementation? What were the advantages and disadvantages of those alternatives?

_(Before planning I had to review nested loops in tables vs divs.  I choose to work with table data because it was easier to manipulate the columns, rows, and the x-factor with conditionals.  But I ran into an issue with starting the index at 0 and integrating the "x".  I sought help and lead in the right direction with putting simple math in the conditional statements.  

It may have been easier to set the output to an empty array as opposed to an empty string for user input boxes to manipulate rows of columns of different sizes.    )_
